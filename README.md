# SD 230 Final

 - Included in this repo are parts 2 and 3 of the SD 230 server-side programming final.
 - I had to use my github pages for another final, so part 1 can be found here:
   https://tjh2.github.io/
 - It is "coding project #4" on the page with an explanation and a link to the program itself.

# Part 2: Calculator Program
- this part of the project involves using express.js to navigate between the program, about page, and a 404 page to handle any paths that are "/" or "about"


# Part 3: Currency Converter Program
- this part of the project is similar to part 2, however it uses a ejs view engine. There is a currency converter page, about page, and a page that generates a table of exchange rates between two selected currencies at the beginning of the month for each month in 2023 with the % lossed or gained compared to the previous month.
